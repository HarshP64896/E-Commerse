          <h3>The Huffington Post</h3>

            <p>
              The history of political blogging might usefully be divided into
              the periods pre- and post-Huffington. Before the millionaire
              socialite Arianna Huffington decided to get in on the act,
              bloggers operated in a spirit of underdog solidarity. They hated
              the mainstream media - and the feeling was mutual.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bloggers saw themselves as gadflies, pricking the arrogance of
              established elites from their home computers, in their pyjamas,
              late into the night. So when, in 2005, Huffington decided to
              mobilise her fortune and media connections to create, from
              scratch, a flagship liberal blog she was roundly derided. Who,
              spluttered the original bloggerati, did she think she was?
            </p>
            <p>
              But the pyjama purists were confounded. Arianna's money talked
              just as loudly online as off, and the Huffington Post quickly
              became one of the most influential and popular journals on the
              web. It recruited professional columnists and celebrity bloggers.
              It hoovered up traffic. Its launch was a landmark moment in the
              evolution of the web because it showed that many of the old rules
              still applied to the new medium: a bit of marketing savvy and deep
              pockets could go just as far as geek credibility, and get there
              faster.
